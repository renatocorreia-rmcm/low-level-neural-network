# Generic Neural Network

Implementation of a generic neural network, for study purposes.

## A low level implementation

Im using no libs besides random.

The goal is to implement all the math used in a neural network by myself. <br>
Im not following any implementation tutorial btw, all my conceitual reference is at the end of this README.

## Overview

The class initialize a neural network object with random weights and biases,
taking amount and size of layers as arguments
