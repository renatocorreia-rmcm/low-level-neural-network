# Generic Neural Network

Implementation of a generic neural network, for study purposes.

## A low level implementation

Im using no libs besides random.

The purpose is to implement all the math used in a neural network by myself,
im not following any implementation tutorial btw.

All the network structure is based on the [neural network conceitual explanation by 3blue1brown](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&feature=shared)


## ToDo
- Cost function
- Back Propagation
